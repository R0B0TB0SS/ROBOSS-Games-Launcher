# ROBOSS Games Launcher
This is a minecraft launcher used to download my <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/robossfactory1">ROBOSS Factory</a> modpack without the Curseforge platform.
The project is made in Java and based on the <a href="https://github.com/FlowArg/FlowUpdater">FlowUpdater</a> library from <a href="https://github.com/FlowArg">Flowarg</a>.
